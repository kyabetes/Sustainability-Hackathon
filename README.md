This is my Clark University spring 2024 hackathon (Spring 2024 Clarkathon) submission.

To use, you will need to replace the placeholders for API keys and the endpoint.
You'll need an OpenAI API key & a Microsoft Azure API key + endpoint. These should be free and you can feel free to try the code for yourself with these!

(If you're having issues running it, I believe you should type 'python gui.py' within the terminal while you're in the same directory as the python file.)

Thanks so much!
